# galaxy
I have used some of the code I wrote for my simulation of the Solar System, which can be visited [here](https://github.com/malmriv/solarsystem). Nevertheless, this is a more ambitious project. I intend to simulate a galaxy and study some of its main properties. I'm also adding new capabilities like:

  * [x] Elastic (and possibly ineslastic) collisions.
  * [ ] Black hole absorption (with star replacement).
  * [ ] A neighbour list to bring down time complexity of the program from O(n^2) to O(n).
 
And maybe some other things, if I think of something interesting before I run out of time. My reference galaxy has been the Milky Way. I have matched the relevant parameters of the simulation to real astronomic data. The mass distribution, central black hole's mass, and the radius of the galaxy approximately match those of the real Milky Way. My analysis does not reach further than that, though. This simulation, although challenging for me, does not take into consideration most variables necessary for an extensive study of the Milky Way.

I will update this readme file once the project is finished, and the results of the simulation will be condensed into a short paper.
