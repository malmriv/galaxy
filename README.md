# galaxy
I have used some of the code I wrote for my simulation of the Solar System, which can be visited [here](https://github.com/malmriv/solarsystem). Nevertheless, this is a more ambitious project. I intend to simulate a galaxy and study some of its main properties. My reference has been the Milky Way, and I have tried to match the parameters of the simulation to real astronomic data. The mass distribution, the mass of the central black hole, and the radius of the galaxy approximately match those of the real Milky Way. My analysis does not reach further than that, though. This simulation, although challenging for me, does not take into consideration most variables necessary for an extensive study of the Milky Way.

I will update this readme file once the project is finished.
